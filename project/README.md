### CS 512 project - Pothole detection in an image using Histogram of gradients					          

Developed an application in python using OpenCV library that computes the histogram of gradients of an image and trains various classifiers to detect presence or absence of pothole in a given image based on the research paper “Computer Vision Based Detection and Localization of Potholes in Asphalt Pavement Images”.
